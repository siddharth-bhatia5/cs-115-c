# All of the functions with the solve prefix are to be implemented using four fours and
# basic math operations to equal the number in the function title. The basic operations are
# +, -, *, /, and parentheses.
# To fill the function out, replace the 0 with your expression so that the function will return
# the number in the function title

# As an example the solution for 12 and a way to test it is given below
# If your output has a decimal in the solution, it will not be counted against you,
# but if you'd like to remove it use // for division


def solve_12():
    return 4 * (4 - 4 // 4)


print(solve_12())  # Will print 12


def solve_0():
    return 4 - 4 + 4 - 4

print(solve_0()) # Will print 0


def solve_1():
    return 4 - 4 + (4 // 4)

print(solve_1()) # Will print 1


def solve_2():
    return 4 * 4 // (4 + 4)

print (solve_2()) # Will print 2


def solve_3():
    return (4 * 4 - 4) // 4

print(solve_3()) # Will print 3


def solve_4():
    return (4 - 4) * 4 + 4

print(solve_4()) # Will print 4


def solve_5():
    return (4 * 4 + 4) // 4

print(solve_5()) # Will print 5


def solve_6():
    return (4 + 4) // 4 + 4

print(solve_6()) # Will print 6


def solve_7():
    return (4 + 4) - (4 // 4)

print(solve_7()) # Will print 7


def solve_8():
    return (4 - 4) + 4 + 4

print(solve_8()) # Will print 8


def solve_9():
    return 4 // 4 + 4 + 4

print(solve_9()) # Will print 9


# To solve this one you're allowed to use any operation you'd like
# This includes factorials, square roots, and concatenation (Using two 4s to make 44)
# The math library has already been imported so you can use math.sqrt(n) for square roots
# and math.factorial(n) for factorials
def solve_10():
    return math.floor(math.sqrt(4) + math.sqrt(4) + math.sqrt(4) + 4)

print(solve_10()) # Will print 10

# The following problems are to act as introductions to lists.
# All of them will use a list, titled lst, in the function which
# you can assume will not produce an error

# Simple tests are given below each function
example_lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Returns the first element of a list

def get_first(lst):
    return lst[0]

print(get_first(example_lst))  # Prints 1


# Returns the last element of a list
def get_last(lst):
    return lst[len(lst) - 1]

print(get_last(example_lst))  # Prints 5


# Returns a list containing all elements except the first
# Hint: use list slices
def remove_first(lst):
    return lst[1:]

print(remove_first(example_lst))  # Prints [2, 3, 4, 5]
