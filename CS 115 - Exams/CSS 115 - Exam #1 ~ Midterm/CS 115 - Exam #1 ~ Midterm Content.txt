   - 1 question on lists (python basics)
   - 1 question on lambda expressions
   - 1 question on map/reduce/filter/etc
   - 1 question on recursion (can be use it/lose it or something more basic so prepare for the worst)
   - 1 question on binary arithmetic (no subtraction, multiplication would be with russian peasants)
- Allowed a study sheet
   - handwritten
   - one sided
   - including the pledge (can be on the back of the paper to save space)
   - turned in, you have to turn it in even if its a blank page
